# hello-world
This is a test project created with educational intentions. Digital tools are to be tested with a couple of students on undergraduate level, too see what works well for them to use, and what is more troublesome. Me, setting up this project, is one of their teachers: Susanne Almgren, PhD of Media and Communication Studies.
