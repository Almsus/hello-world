# hello-world
This is a test project created with educational intentions. Digital tools are to be tested with a couple of students on undergraduate level, too see what works well for them to use, and what is more troublesome. Me, setting up this project, is one of their teachers: Susanne Almgren, PhD of Media and Communication Studies.
I did my PhD at Jönköping University, Sweden. My dissertation "Users and Producers: Online News as Mediated Participation" concerns how the relationships between online news users and news producers take various forms in the contemporary media landscape with news article comments and news being shared through social media.
